# The Vocabulator

_"Vocabulator's gonna vocabulate -late -late -late!"_ --Taylor Swift


The Vocabulator breeds horrifying mutant hybrid novels, combining the
sentence structure of one novel with the vocabulary of others. It is
currently a work in progress.

My (still evolving) novel for November, titled "A Dream of Large 
Vermin", is [available on my website](http://makingcodespeak.com/a-dream-of-large-vermin.txt),
though it will be subject to change throughout the month as I enhance
the code that generates it.

This is my NaNoGenMo 2014 project. Better documentation to follow, if
you're lucky. Enjoy!
